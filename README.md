# Improving-deep-neural-networks
This repository is a comprehensive guide to building deep learning models entirely from scratch using NumPy. It focuses on the fundamental principles and best practices for designing, training, and optimizing neural networks without relying on high-level machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
